    """
    Displayes preview on PiTFT with PiCamera.add_overlay(). Displayed animation
    is composed of two layers; One continuously displays the input from camera
    while another continuously gets refreshed every time a calculation is done.
    It worls faster because the layers are divided and the original preview
    layer does not get affected by another layer that requires some calculation
    and image creation.
    It, however, has a weak point. This outputs to default display device,
    /dev/fb0. To display the same output to PiTFT, /dev/fb1, you need to use
    rpi-fbcp and let it copy the /dev/fb0 output to /dev/fb1.
